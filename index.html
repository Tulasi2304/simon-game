            <p>The Simon game is a classic electronic memory game that tests a player's ability to recall and replicate a sequence of lights and sounds. It features a console with four colored buttons that generate a random sequence of lights and corresponding sounds. To succeed, the player must accurately mimic the sequence by pressing the correct buttons in the right order.</p>

            <p>The player is expected to click on the button that blinks, and advance to the next level. In the subsequent levels, the player should click the buttons in the exact sequence which appeared in the previous levels and also include the one appearing in the present level. The game continues until the player presses a wrong button, which ends the game.</p>
